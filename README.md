Medal-FFmpeg README

This is our private FFmpeg fork used to for all our backend and frontend builds.
Our builds are not produced here, but in our Medal-FFmpeg-Builds repository which fetches the corresponding branches from here.

Here is an overview of how that works:

FFmpeg README
=============

FFmpeg is a collection of libraries and tools to process multimedia content
such as audio, video, subtitles and related metadata.

## Libraries

* `libavcodec` provides implementation of a wider range of codecs.
* `libavformat` implements streaming protocols, container formats and basic I/O access.
* `libavutil` includes hashers, decompressors and miscellaneous utility functions.
* `libavfilter` provides means to alter decoded audio and video through a directed graph of connected filters.
* `libavdevice` provides an abstraction to access capture and playback devices.
* `libswresample` implements audio mixing and resampling routines.
* `libswscale` implements color conversion and scaling routines.

## Tools

* [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.html) is a command line toolbox to
  manipulate, convert and stream multimedia content.
* [ffplay](https://ffmpeg.org/ffplay.html) is a minimalistic multimedia player.
* [ffprobe](https://ffmpeg.org/ffprobe.html) is a simple analysis tool to inspect
  multimedia content.
* Additional small tools such as `aviocat`, `ismindex` and `qt-faststart`.
